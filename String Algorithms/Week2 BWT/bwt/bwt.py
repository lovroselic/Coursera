        This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by 
        techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, 
        without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a "free" 
        method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation.$"""
